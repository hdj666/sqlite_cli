# sqlite_cli

This is work-in-progress, there is a long way to version 1.

A sqlite shell written in python with some features that I need and the sqlite3 commandline tool
did not provide.

* Heavily use of auto-completition.
* Commandhistory file.

## Missing features for release 1.0:
    * global config
    * Config per DB
    * Exec file nativ call
    * Store queries with parameters (positional and named)
    * threading for background queries
