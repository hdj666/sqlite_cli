# sqlite_cli
sqlite shell

A sqlite shell written in python with some features that I need and the sqlite3 commandline tool did not provide.

Missing features:
    o) global config
    o) Config per DB
    o) Exec file nativ call
    o) Store queries with parameters (positional and named)
    o) threading for background queries
